Many people who enjoy the health insurance benefits through their employer might be wondering why it is still quite expensive when they see their doctor and pay the out of pocket expenses, especially with the health insurance premiums being what they are currently. As bad as this situation is, it is nothing compared to those who are living without any type of health insurance coverage or who are having to pay for a insurance policy from a private pay insurance company. Which do you think is the most expensive?

Most people don't realize the huge overall expense that health insurance coverage is unless they have to find their own without the help of a employer sponsored policy. Many also don't realize that this type of policy is not only subsidized by the employer and to make it a better deal, this health insurance plan is acquired at a discounted rate simple because of the number of people who will be serviced by the plan. Getting the same coverage on your own, can in fact be much more expensive.

The sad reality for individuals or head of households who have jobs without the luxury of health insurance benefits, will find that affordable health insurance is mostly just out of reach, unless of course you are very independently wealthy or at the other end of the financial spectrum; being poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. If this is your situation, you still have available options that do include temporary or catastrophic health insurance.

The above mentioned options will at least help you provide some protection for yourself and family while you seek out and secure a more permanent and affordable option. In the insurance arena, there are few comparable options that equal the employer based health insurance plans and there benefits. These plans are still the best bang for the buck and provide the best coverage available for most people needing health insurance.

Consider yourself to be a very blessed and lucky person if you are enjoying coverage by a employer based health insurance plan. The importance of understanding the value of these plans cannot be overlooked, especially when there are many families and individuals who are far from getting this type of coverage for themselves and their families. It is important that everyone have health insurance for the what if situations and if necessary you might want to contact your local Medicaid office to inquire about getting help if you qualify and while you continue to find employment that offers health insurance benefits to its employees.
